Syntax for running: ./run.sh <path-to-testcase> <number-of-clients> <phase>

For eg: ./run.sh ./Testing/Testcases/tc5_0 5 3

This will store the output in a folder called Output

The folder sol5_0 contains files ans_x_y which is the expected output of client x on phase y

Use diff with -Bw option to check if the output is correct
